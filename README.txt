If you play Mass Effect 3 co-op multiplayer (any platform) and have created 
a profile at http://social.bioware.com/n7hq/ this program is something quick 
I threw together to help keep track of items you've unlocked.

As long as you've set up your profile on the N7HQ website (otherwise it 
won't display your information) with this program you can enter your username 
(gamertag, Origin ID, whatever; and this program doesn't need your password 
or anything of course) and download a copy of your current inventory.
This is then saved to a file which you can view or compare with copies you 
saved previously. A new file won't be saved if it would be identical to the 
most recent copy.

Everything is just displayed in a text box, examples are below. Levels for 
characters are how many times you've unlocked the same class, gaining more 
customization options, not the current experience point level for that class.
The total percentages include the sum of every level for everything, 
so 10 for each weapon for example.

This program is pretty rough around the edges but it works, so I thought I'd
publish it. Thanks for reading.
